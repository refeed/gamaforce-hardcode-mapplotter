# GAMAFORCE Hardcode MapPlotter

**WARNING: THIS CODE HAS SOME NASTY BUGS INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) SQL INJECTION**

I made this project to fullfil my final project on "Web Programming 1" subject
on my university.

This project is also made to help my team in GAMAFORCE, especially the
Technology Development Flight Controller team to help them hardcode the
drone's mission coordinates on their flight controller.

## How to setup a development environment

Just setup `docker`, `docker-compose` in your machine then run:
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```
